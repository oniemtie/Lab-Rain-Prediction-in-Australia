# Lab-Rain-Prediction-in-Australia

For this final project, you will utilize JupyterLite running on the Cloud in the Skills Network Labs environment. 

You will be using Australian rainfall data to practice all the classification algorithms learned in this course.

Once you have completed the lab, you can download the notebook by navigating to "File" and clicking on the "Download" button. This will save the (.ipynb) file on your computer. Once saved, you can upload the "ML0101EN_SkillUp_FinalAssignment.ipynb" file to the "My Submission" tab of the "Peer-graded Assignment" section.

In the course's next "Peer Review" section, follow the instructions to submit the downloaded "ML0101EN_SkillUp_FinalAssignment.ipynb" file, along with your screenshots.
